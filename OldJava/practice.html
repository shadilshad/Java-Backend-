        <h2><i><u>Self-Reflection</u></i></h2>
        <p><i>There are moments when we question ourselves and wonder if we are the reason behind certain problems. This thought often comes from caring too much or wanting to understand what went wrong. It shows emotional maturity — the ability to pause and look inward instead of blaming others.</i></p>

        <h2><i><u>Realization and Growth</u></i></h2>
        <p><i>Over time, we learn that not everything is our fault. Some situations simply happen beyond our control. Real growth begins when we recognize the difference between self-awareness and self-blame, allowing us to move forward with clarity and confidence.</i></p>
